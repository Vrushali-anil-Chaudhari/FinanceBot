### How RAG Works

FinanceBot is powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a method that combines retrieval and generation to provide accurate and relevant responses. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. User Query Input
The user enters a question or provides financial details.

2. Retrieval Phase
The chatbot queries the vector database for the most relevant information.
The knowledge base is preloaded with financial advice stored as vector embeddings, enabling efficient retrieval.

3. Augmentation Phase
Retrieved information is combined with the user's input to provide context.

4. Response Generation
A pre-trained language model processes the augmented input to generate a conversational and accurate response.

### Features

1. Interactive UI: Built using Streamlit for ease of use.
2. Efficient Search: Leverages vector databases for quick and relevant results.
3. Scalable Design: The architecture supports adding more financial knowledge seamlessly.
4. Beginner-Friendly Setup: Minimal prerequisites and straightforward installation.
